CVPuppets
Noah D’Souza, Chase Joyner, Rachel Won

The Big Idea: The main idea of our project is to create a program that can accurately replicate the movements of a person with an animation. We would like to explore the concepts of computer vision, hardware integration, and animation to generate a sort of “puppet show”. Our minimum viable product is just a a program that can recognize our movements and at least display a skeleton of sorts that mimics them.  

What is a stretch goal? Adding a 3D stl model and creating fluid animations.

Learning Goals: Noah’s learning goals are to figure out OpenCV and get better at using classes. Chase’s learning goals is to learn and understand OpenCV and create animations with the CV tracking. Rachel’s learning goals is to effectively use OpenCV to track human motion (hopefully with minimal lag) and to learn how to create a baseline GUI for the user to interact with (so they can choose which image to overlay)

Implementation Plan: We will first read up on documentation of OpenCV and using a Kinect with Python, after which we will experiment with putting those three elements together. We have identified a few resources that at least combine two of the core elements of this project. We will definitely use OpenCV, and will likely test multiple different methods for including a Kinect.

Project schedule: 
Week 1: Figure out how to use OpenCV, in tandem with the Kinect
Week 2: Be able to generate an image overlay over the OpenCV detection of the human
Week 3-5: Use changes in the human’s motion to dictate the motions of the overlayed image. 
Week 6: Refine project, create website, make poster and presentation

Collaboration plan: Divide and conquer with some pair programming in order to integrate and implement the code. Everyone will likely will be working on a different component of the code that is essential for the end product.

Risks: The biggest risks of the project are tracking a semi-accurate motion using the CV and converting the motion into animation. The other big risk is that none of us actually have any experience using CV, so there is a pretty steep learning curve.

Additional Course Content: An animation crash course would be useful. 3D animating and bone configuration and converting. Any explanations of OpenCV or information on where to get and how to use a Kinect (preferably from the XBox 360) would also be helpful.
