#### *Software Design 2018 Final Project*

## Description
Inspired by the infamous Microsoft Paint, we wanted to create a fun interactive computer vision program where you can draw a picture using your hand as a cursor. The program has the capabilities of changing the color of your cursor and have and eraser to delete and misguided/unintended strokes. You will have the function to save your creation afterwards!

### Getting Started
CVPaint was designed on Ubuntu, so we strongly recommend you use Ubuntu to run it.

Make sure the computer you are using has a webcam - we used the built-in webcams in Dell Latitude laptops

Uncover your webcam if you put something over it…We know Zuck is watching but CVPaint needs image input!

### Dependencies
You will need several packages in order to run CVPaint (if you don’t already have them):
* OpenCV
  * `$ pip install opencv-python`
* iMutils
  * `$ pip install imutils`

### Usage
Grab the code from our GitHub by running
```
$ git clone https://github.com/noahdsouza/CVPaint.git
```
And then run `color_tracker.py`

### License
This repo is free to use. Go nuts. Edits are welcome if they improve the program.
