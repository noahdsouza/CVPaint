# About Us

CVPaint was our final project for Software Design, a class at the Olin College of Engineering.

The purpose of the final project is to be a culmination of our learning, and to focus in on one topic the whole group is interersted in. Our group chose Computer Vision, which is the process of computationally analyzing and working with visual inputs from various image capturing tools.
