# Big Idea
Inspired by the infamous Microsoft Paint, we wanted to create a fun interactive computer vision program where you can draw a picture using your hand as a cursor. The program has the capabilities of changing the color of your cursor and have and eraser to delete and misguided/unintended strokes. You will have the function to save your creation afterwards!

# Project Evolution
CVPaint wasn't always a painting program!

Way back when, CVPaint was a Software Design project called CVPuppets which was supposed to take collect depth information from a Microsoft Kinect and mimic human movements with a 3D model.

Turns out, that's really difficult, which normally wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we felt we should pivot to something more feasible. From that, we came up with CVPaint!

Let's talk some more about CVPuppets.
