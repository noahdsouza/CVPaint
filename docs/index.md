# CVPaint

## Big Idea
Inspired by the infamous Microsoft Paint, we wanted to create a fun interactive computer vision program where you can draw a picture using your hand as a cursor. The program has the capabilities of changing the color of your cursor and have and eraser to delete and misguided/unintended strokes. You will have the function to save your creation afterwards!
